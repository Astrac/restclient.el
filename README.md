# restclient.el

This is a tool to manually explore and test HTTP REST webservices. Runs queries from a plain-text query sheet, displays results as a pretty-printed XML, JSON and even images.

# Usage

Deploy restclient.el into your site-lisp as usual, require it and make a text file with queries. C-c C-c runs the one under the cursor.
